Metal has been made possible by the earlier work done in [Debox](http://github.com/non/debox).
Random frustration with the quirks of Scala specialization led to the current project.

The `core` subproject could be adapted to deal with off-heap memory, see for example:

- [LArray](https://github.com/xerial/larray),
- [scala-offheap](https://github.com/densh/scala-offheap).
